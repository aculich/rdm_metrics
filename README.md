# rdm_metrics
Scripts for cleaning, counting, displaying, etc. Research Data Managemnent program metrics

I've added my initial Python 3.4 script, RDM_metrics_FY2015-Q2.py. It takes an argument that points at a .csv file exported from the RDM Drupal site (via a Drupal view called 'Ricks_view').

To run, navigate to the folder that contains the script and the .csv file and enter:
python3 RDM_metrics_FY2015-Q2.py {csv file name}
