# rdm_metrics
Scripts for cleaning, counting, displaying, etc. Research Data Management program metrics

After May 4, 2016, please use the Python script RDM_metrics_genericized.py and the configuration file config_v2.py. The script operates on a .csv file exported from the RDM Drupal knowledge Base. Contact Rick or Jamie for information on how to download the CSV file.

The Python script takes two arguments: 

• The first argument points to the .csv file, stored locally on your computer
• The second provides the text that describes the period that the report covers.

To run, download or clone the script and the configuration file to the same folder on your local machine, and (in your terminal or shell, etc.) navigate to the folder that contains them. Locate the path to the .csv file and enter:

     python RDM_metrics_genericized.py {csv filepath and name} {report period descriptor}

For example:
     python RDM_metrics_genericized.py /path/to/file/RDMConsulting_Ricks_view_FY2015-16_Q3_2016-05-04T17-15-48.csv FY2015-16_Q3

(no line break)

This will run the script on the file RDMConsulting_Ricks_view_FY2015-16_Q3_2016-05-04T17-15-48.csv. The ouptut will include a line that reads:

     In FY2015-16_Q3, RDM Consulting provided {x} consultations.
     We reached a successful resolution in {y} of those engagements.

(The text 'FY2015-16_Q3' comes directly from the second argument supplied.)
